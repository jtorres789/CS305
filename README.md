1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
	Artemis Financial is a company that focuses on creating financial plans for people that can range from their savings to 		retirements, to investments and insurance. To me the value of having secure communication is of greater importance. We must consider that Artemis is handling classified information from their clients, like SSN, tax info, address, assets, etc. Knowing this and reading that there is no location for the Artemis company, we can assume that they delve into international transactions. They must make sure they do not have any exposure to information about let’s say trade secrets, as this is a governmental restriction. One of the main external threats is the is the targeting of any clients Artemis can have, their personal info and such. Maybe doing maintenance checks for any bug fixes would be a modernized requirement that Artemis could consider.


2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I made a fair, and good review of their code and addressed potential areas where security would be at risk. it is important to code securely so the customer important internal data does not get hacked or exposed by outsiders. this adds value to the overall wellbeing of the company's assets. 


3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? the suppresion of of dependencies was very challenging in my mind.
   
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? I added secure suppresions and stopgaps in place to verify the process. checked dependdencies and made sure no issues where not considered.
   
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? I verified after every change I did not add any new vulnerabilities.
   
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?I believe one thing i can add is more inline comments to delineate what it is being worked in the code. and comments to every version being updated.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? I beleive the identification of issues in the area of security, and the identification of vulnerabilities. the code would be also another one.
